            <h3 class ="box">A Somewhat Simple Day</h3>
            <p> Friday was quite an ordinary day for me. I woke up around the afternoon and attended my lectures. Then I 
                left my apartment around mid-day and went on my daily walk. I regularly go on walks to keep up in exercise
                during times of covid. I like to go randomly around my neighborhood listening to music and they are quite relaxing 
                and help clear my mind.
                Later I went home and watched to some basketball and waited for some of my friends back home to come down.

            <h2 id="sat">Saturday</h2>
            <p> I hungout with friends today and made some dinner. My dinner consisted of:
                <ol id="list1">
                    <li>Salmon</li>
                    <li>Rice</li>
                    <li>Bak Choy</li>
                </ol>
                After that my friends and I played a fun game of <strong>Codenames</strong>. Which is a fun board game involving
                teams in which they guess words from one another based off of clues.

            <h2 id="sun">Sunday</h2>
            <p> 
                Sunday I got some food with my housemates. We got a spot in La Jolla we enjoy called <i>Poki One N Half</i>.
                Later on my housemates and I watched some e-sports. Today was the playoffs of <em>League of Legends</em> the North American regionals.
                After that I worked on school work all day and watched a cool Amazon Prime show called <i>Invincible</i>.
